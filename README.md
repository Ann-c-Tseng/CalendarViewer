# Calendar Display

### Project Summary:
This is a calendar app that displays the current month, year, and weekly dates.
Development currently continues for toggling and changing the month/year.

### Project Process + Solution:
I wanted to see if I can create a calendar display given the current date of the user. Using the current date, I found the current month's days, as well as necessary prior month days and future month days to be displayed alongside the current month's view.
After figuring out how to gather the necessary day values for the current month, prior month, and future month, I then worked on to style the calendar.
This calendar's date display changes based on given month and year dynamically, including leap years.

### Tools Used:
React JS, HTML, CSS, MUI icons

### Project Link: To be displayed
