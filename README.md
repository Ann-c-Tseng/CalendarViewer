# Calendar Display

### Project Summary:
This is a calendar app that displays the current month, year, and weekly dates.
Users can change the month and year selections accordingly.

### Project Process + Solution:
I created a calendar display given the current date of the user. Using the current date, I found the current month's days, as well as necessary prior month days and future month days to be displayed alongside the current month's view.
After figuring out how to gather the necessary day values for the current month, prior month, and future month, I then worked on to style the calendar.
This calendar's date display changes based on given month and year dynamically, including leap years (Such as February 2024).

### Tools Used:
React JS, HTML, CSS
